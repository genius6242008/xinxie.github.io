<div class="about">
    <img src="/img/word_cloud.png">
    <p>I am interested in the cognitive and neural processes underlying speech processing, in the context of native and non-native communication. I combine psycholinguistic experimentation and functional neuroimaging methods (fMRI; recently, learning to apply statistical modeling) in my research to investigate how experience-dependent plasticity occurs (perceptual adaptation, long-term L2 learning). My most current line of work investigates foreign accent adaptation and its generalization across talkers, as well as maintenance over time. Specifically, I hope to better understand how people learn and represent structured variability (e.g., talker information) in spoken languages and the neural mechanisms that support such learning and representations. :</p>

        <p>The interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit (ISIB) in speech recognition</p>
<p>Foreign-accented speech deviates from native norms of the target language and is generally harder to understand than native speech. However, Bent and Bradlow (2003) found that non-native speech is not always less intelligible than native speech. Instead, non-native speech can be more easily understood than native speech when there is shared language background between the speaker and the listener.
My work builds upon this finding and investigates the influences of both long-term (L1) and short-term (ambient language environment) language experience in modulating the “ISIB” by comparing L1 speakers with L2 speakers in different language environments.
Effective use of this information depends on the shared language experience between the talker and the listener. The weighting and integration of various acoustic cues is important for speech perception and language experience fundamentally shapes listeners’ cue-weighting strategies.</p>
<p> Current work along this line involves further characterization of the phonetic variation in Mandarin-accented speech, based on large samples of natural speech production. A special focus is on under-studied phonemes and production patterns in connected speech.</p>
